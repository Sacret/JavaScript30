Hi! My name is Anastasia and I'm taking part in <a href="https://javascript30.com">#javascript30</a> challenge.
The main goal is to create 30 things with Vanilla JS in 30 days. Without transpilers, libraries, frameworks, and so on.
Also all code is in ES6 so only modern browsers have ability to handle it.

You can see all my results here: https://sacret.github.io/JavaScript30/
